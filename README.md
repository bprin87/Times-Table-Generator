# Times-Table-Generator
Simple multiplication game which generates sums at random.

The game has been built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Initially the idea was to create a random quote generator but I wanted to build something a bit more interesting in order to improve my knowledge of the Document Object Model.

Here's a demonstration:

Further features to be added include:

- Subtraction, division, and addition operators.
- Score tables for all operators.
- CSS animation.
